      <p class="h1" align="center">Who is Prabhupāda?</p>

      <br /><br /><br />
      <p>
        At various times people have called him a scholar, a philosopher, a
        cultural ambassador, a prolific author, a religious leader, a spiritual
        teacher, a social critic, and a holy man. In truth, he was all these
        things and more.
        <br /><br />
        Over five hundred years ago, Lord Sri Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya
        Mahaprabhu in Navadvipa, a village in West Bengal. The purpose of His
        appearance was to inaugurate the Sankirtana Movement, the Yuga Dharma
        for this age of Kali. He declared that the chanting of His holy names
        would spread beyond the shores of India to every town and village in the
        world. He predicted that His commander-in-chief would appear to
        accomplish this mission.
        <br /><br />
        Yes… Srila Prabhupada appeared to fulfill this prophecy.
        <br /><br />
        On September 01, 1896, the day after Janmashtami (the auspicious
        appearance day of Lord Sri Krishna) in a little house in the Tollygunge
        suburb of Calcutta, a male child was born. His father, Gour Mohan De,
        and his mother Rajani, named him Abhay Charan (one who is fearless -
        having taken shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna).
        <br /><br />
        An astrologer prepared the horoscope for the baby and revealed: When
        this child reaches the age of seventy, he will cross the ocean, become a
        great teacher of religion and establish 108 Krishna temples.
        <br /><br />
        And this is exactly what happened.
        <br /><br />
        Srila Prabhupada set out to America in 1965 and established the
        International Society for Krishna Consciousness at the age of
        sixty-nine. He travelled around the world fourteen times, established
        more than 100 temples of Krishna and initiated more than 10000 disciples
        into Krishna consciousness.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br />

      <p class="h1" align="center">Accomplishments of Srila Prabhupada</p>

      <br /><br /><br />
      <p>
        Srila Prabhupada's attempts to propagate Krishna Consciousness were not
        received well by the people in India. At the age of 69 (in the year
        1965) he went to the United States of America and incorporated the
        International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). In the next 11
        years, he circled the globe fourteen times inspiring his followers,
        delivering lectures, and discussing the philosophy of Krishna
        Consciousness with all interested persons. Srila Prabhupada arrived in
        the US during the decade of discontent; there was widespread
        dissatisfaction with America's war with Vietnam. The American youth
        created their counter-culture popularly known as hippie culture. They
        were trying to break away from the status quo, searching for an
        alternative. Srila Prabhupada presented this alternative.
        <br /><br />
        Srila Prabhupada brought the Hare Krishna Movement to the public eye by:
        <br /><br />
        chanting in the parks,<br />
        distributing the Back to Godhead Magazine,<br />
        conducting love feasts,<br />
        delivering lectures from the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam in a
        rented store-front. <br /><br />
        Thus, he attracted many youngsters, who gradually became his disciples.
        Srila Prabhupada trained his disciples in the tradition of Deity
        Worship, to help them advance spiritually. The Supreme Lord appears in
        the form of Deities to give us an opportunity to serve Him; and by
        rendering services to the Deities with utmost care one can advance
        spiritually. When we are attracted to the beautiful form of the Deities,
        we will forget our attraction to material things; and by serving the
        Deities we will develop pure love of God and thus our lives will be
        successful.
        <br /><br />
        To revive the Krishna conscious tradition, he envisioned God-centered
        self-sufficient farm communities based on the principles of Simple
        Living, High Thinking. In 1972, he started a gurukul in Dallas, Texas –
        an educational institution set up according to the traditional Vedic
        model. He established more than 108 temples and instructed his disciples
        that no one should go hungry within a 10 mile radius of an ISKCON
        temple.

      <p class="h1">Teachings of Srila Prabhuapada</p>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <p>
        Srila Prabhupada is the spiritual ambassador who visited our planet to
        give us the message of Godhead and invite us to come back home - back to
        Godhead. We publish various articles on our blog on different aspects of
        his teachings. However, we realize our limitation in capturing all the
        teachings of Srila Prabhupada in a few pages of a website.
        <br /><br />
        According to Srila Prabhupada, Krishna Consciousness is not an arm-chair
        philosophy or a part-time religion; it is a way of life. He presented
        the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness very extensively in his books
        and we request you to make it a habit to read Srila Prabhupada's books
        and be benefited by them.
