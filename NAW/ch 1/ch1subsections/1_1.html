      The Prime Religious Practice for the Kali-yuga is the Chanting of the Holy
      name
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The chanting of the holy name is the most sublime religion for the
      Kali-yuga
    </h2>
    <h2>
      In Kali-yuga, simply by chanting the holy name one can attain the goal of
      life
    </h2>
    <h2>
      In Kali-yuga, one can attain liberation and return to the spiritual
      kingdom by chanting the holy name
    </h2>
    <h2>Sankirtana is the present yuga-dharma</h2>
    <h2>
      The only religious principle in the age of Kali is the chanting of the
      holy name
    </h2>
    <h2>
      In Kali-yuga, chanting of the holy name is the most feasible means of
      salvation
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The universal religious practice for the Kali-yuga is the chanting of the
      holy name
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The Srimad-Bhagavatam advocates nama-sankirtana as the essence of religion
      in the age of Kali
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Rather than inventing one's own religious process, one should accept the
      approved method of religion for this age-hari-nama-sankirtana
    </h2>
    <h2>Chanting the holy name is the sum and substance of sanatana-dharma</h2>
    <h2>
      In Kali-yuga Krsna has incarnated as the holy name in order to deliver the
      sinful, who are suffering greatly
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Because Kali-yuga is such a degraded and miserable age, Lord Caitanya
      advises everyone simply to chant Hare Krsna
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Everywhere in this age of iron everything is degraded, degraded in this
      sense
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The lack of religious principles in Kali-yuga is more than compensated by
      the process of chanting the holy name
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the common platform for the
      universal religion of mankind in the Kali-yuga
    </h2>
    <h2>
      In the age of logic, argument and disagreement, the chanting of Hare Krsna
      is the only means of self-realization
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The Hare Krsna mantra is especially suited to deliver us from the dangers
      of the Kali-yuga
    </h2>
